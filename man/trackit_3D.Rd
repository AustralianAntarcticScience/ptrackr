trackit_3D(pts, romsobject, w_sink = 100, time = 50)

\item{pts}{input points}

\item{w_sink}{sinking rate m/days}

\item{time}{total number of days to run the model}

\description{
Function to track particles through a ROMS-field.
}
\details{
the function needs an input for speed of the sinking particles (w_sink) and for time
due to the limitation of RAM available, time is restricted depending on the number of particles
(too long runs might give an error because the generated vector is too large)
I found half days work great

\examples{
data(surface_chl)
data(toyROMS)
pts <- create_points_pattern(surface_chl, multi=100)
track <- trackit_3D(pts = pts, romsobject = toyROMS)

plot(pts)
points(track$pnow, col="red")

library(rgl)
plot3d(pts, zlim = c(-1500,1))
plot3d(track$pnow, col="red", add=TRUE)
