# ptrackr

Both tracking in 2D and 3D work well. There is the option to merge the two trackit functions as most of the code is redundant (the respective lines have comments).

For a large number of points, looping over short trackit-functions and removing the particles that have settled makes things a lot faster. That's the aim of loopit_2D3D.

## other things to do: 
 - write a function to map the output of loopit
